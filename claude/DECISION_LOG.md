# Decision Log

A running, append-only record of every pertinent engineering decision for the
ClickHouse SQL Web Editor. Newest decisions go at the bottom. Each entry is
ADR-lite: **Context → Decision → Consequences → Alternatives**.

## DL-001 — Use ClickHouse "Click UI" as the component library

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User (product owner)
- **Context:** The assignment links to ClickHouse's own design system, Click UI
  (`@clickhouse/click-ui`, Apache-2.0). Using it signals familiarity with the
  ClickHouse stack and gives us Table, Button, Select, Dialog, Tabs, Accordion,
  Toast, Alert, FileInput, and more out of the box.
- **Decision:** Adopt `@clickhouse/click-ui` as the presentational component
  library. Wrap the app in `<ClickUIProvider>`, which delivers styles via its JS import
  graph — **no manual CSS import** (v0.6.1 exposes no `cui.css` subpath; corrected per FE
  review R1. Theming/tokens: DL-021).
- **Consequences:**
  - Pulls in peer deps: `styled-components@^6`, `dayjs@^1.11`, `react@^18.3`.
  - Click UI ships **no interactive code editor** (its `CodeBlock` is read-only),
    so the SQL editor is a separate decision — see DL-002.
  - Standard primitives (Table, Dialog, Select, Toast) come for free, reducing the
    amount of presentational code we hand-write.
- **Alternatives considered:** Lightweight custom CSS (more control, less on-brand);
  Tailwind (extra build config, not tied to the ClickHouse stack). Rejected in favor
  of the first-party design system.

## DL-002 — Buy CodeMirror 6 for the SQL editor

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User, after buy-vs-build spike (see `SPIKE-buy-vs-build.md`)
- **Context:** Click UI has no editor. We need syntax highlighting, line numbers,
  and ideally schema autocomplete.
- **Decision:** **Buy** CodeMirror 6 via `@uiw/react-codemirror` + `@codemirror/lang-sql`
  (both MIT, actively maintained, ~29 kB gzip for the wrapper).
- **Consequences:**
  - CodeMirror's **extension system maps directly onto our "addons as editor plugins"
    requirement** (see DL-006) — plugins can contribute CM extensions.
  - `@codemirror/lang-sql` has no native ClickHouse dialect; generic SQL highlighting
    works today, and a custom dialect (`SQLDialect.define(...)`) can be added later as
    a small, isolated enhancement.
  - Schema-aware autocomplete is possible by feeding table/column names into `sql({schema})`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Monaco (`@monaco-editor/react`) — ~10x heavier
  (~500 kB gzip), needs Vite web-worker setup, overkill for a focused SQL editor.
  Plain `<textarea>` (build) — zero deps but weakest UX and we'd reimplement plugin
  hooks ourselves.

---

## DL-003 — Buy `dbgate-query-splitter` for multi-statement splitting

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User, after buy-vs-build spike
- **Context:** Multi-statement scripts must be split into individual statements before
  execution. Splitting SQL correctly requires respecting string literals, `--` and
  `/* */` comments, and semicolons inside strings.
- **Decision:** **Buy** `dbgate-query-splitter` (MIT, zero-dependency, maintained) and
  run it on the **backend**.
- **Consequences:**
  - No library certifies the ClickHouse dialect, so we must choose the closest options
    preset (likely MySQL-style options) and **add unit tests covering ClickHouse edge
    cases** (e.g. `''` quote-escaping, backtick identifiers, `--`/`/* */` comments).
  - If preset coverage proves insufficient, we fall back to a custom options object
    (a new decision will be logged).
- **Alternatives considered:** Build a ~80-line hand-rolled tokenizer (more control,
  but reinventing a solved problem); `node-sql-parser` (full AST, ~500 kB, overkill,
  also no ClickHouse dialect).

---

## DL-004 — Split, classify, and execute multi-statement scripts on the backend

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** Engineering
- **Context:** The current `POST /query` runs a single statement and returns only
  `{ rows }` with no column metadata. We need per-statement results with columns,
  types, row counts, and timing.
- **Decision:** Keep all SQL execution semantics on the **backend**:
  1. Split the script (DL-003).
  2. Classify each statement by leading keyword: data-returning
     (`SELECT`/`WITH`/`SHOW`/`DESCRIBE`/`EXPLAIN`/`EXISTS`) → `client.query({ format: 'JSON' })`;
     everything else → `client.command()`.
  3. Execute sequentially, **stop on first error**.
  4. Return HTTP 200 with `{ statements: StatementResult[] }` (per-statement errors are
     data, not transport failures); reserve 4xx/5xx for malformed requests / server faults.
  - Use `format: 'JSON'` (not `JSONEachRow`) to get `meta` (column name+type),
    `rows`, and `statistics.elapsed` for free.
  - Cap returned rows server-side (default 1000) with a `truncated` flag.
- **Consequences:** Frontend stays purely presentational + state; backend owns
  correctness. The single-statement `{ rows }` contract is replaced (only consumer is
  our own SPA).
- **Alternatives considered:** Client-side splitting (leaks execution logic into the UI);
  sending the whole script in one HTTP request (ClickHouse HTTP runs one statement per
  request and we'd lose per-statement results).

---

## DL-005 — Layered frontend architecture (presentation / hooks / context / services) + SOLID

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User (driving principles)
- **Context:** The deliverable is judged on architecture, maintainability, component
  design, and state management. User mandated: separate business logic from pure
  presentational components; hooks for the business-logic layer; Context/providers for
  state; extract business-logic flows into services/providers; follow SOLID; avoid
  over-engineering.
- **Decision:** Four explicit layers:
  1. **Presentation** — pure, `React.memo`'d components (props only, no IO), built on Click UI.
  2. **State** — React Context + providers, split by update frequency (see DL-010).
  3. **Business logic** — custom hooks (`useEditor`, `usePlugins`) + TanStack Query hooks
     (run / history / saved / schema — DL-020).
  4. **Services** — framework-agnostic TS (thin typed fetch fns + domain `types`).
  - SOLID mapping: SRP (each layer one reason to change), OCP (plugins extend without
    modifying core — DL-006), ISP (small interfaces like `EditorPlugin`, `ToolbarAction`),
    DIP (components depend on hook/service abstractions; `apiClient` injected via provider
    for testability).
- **Consequences:** More files/indirection than a single-component app, but each piece is
  small and testable. We deliberately keep abstractions minimal (DL-008) to avoid
  over-engineering.

---

## DL-006 — File upload deferred; addons modeled as editor plugins

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** File upload (bonus) is wanted eventually, but the priority is a
  maintainable, easily extensible base product into which features slot cleanly. User
  directive: "treat addons (like file upload) as an editor plugin."
- **Decision:** Build a **minimal plugin registry** now; defer the file-upload feature.
  - `EditorPlugin` interface: `{ id, toolbarActions?, commands?, panels?, codeMirrorExtensions? }`.
  - A `PluginProvider` collects plugins; the toolbar renders contributed `toolbarActions`,
    the editor mounts contributed CM extensions, a panel host renders `panels`.
  - Core "Run" stays built-in (avoid over-engineering); plugins are for optional addons.
  - **File upload (future)** = a `fileImportPlugin` contributing an "Import" toolbar button
    + a Click UI Dialog panel, calling `apiClient.importFile` → a future `POST /import`
    (multer) endpoint. Only the seam (registry + interface + example wiring) is built now.
- **Consequences:** New features attach without touching editor core (OCP). Plugin system
  is intentionally lean — no event bus or lifecycle hooks beyond `register`.
- **Alternatives considered:** Bolt file upload directly into the toolbar (fast, but not
  extensible); full plugin framework with lifecycle/events (over-engineered for scope).

---

## DL-007 — Vite + React 18 + TypeScript 5 toolchain; Express serves the built SPA

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** Engineering
- **Context:** Repo is currently backend-only (Express + tsx, TypeScript 4.9, `@types/node@16`,
  tslint). It needs a React build pipeline, and opening `/` must render the React app.
- **Decision:**
  - Add a Vite + React + TS app under `web/`. Single root `package.json`.
  - Scripts: `dev` (concurrently runs Express + Vite, Vite proxies `/query` → :8080),
    `build` (`vite build` → `dist/public`), `start` (`NODE_ENV=production tsx src/index.ts`
    serving the built SPA at `/` with an SPA fallback).
  - **Upgrade `typescript` 4.9 → ^5.4** and **`@types/node` 16 → ^20** (README already
    requires Node 20+); **drop `tslint`** (EOL) — optionally replace with ESLint later.
    Keep `tsx`.
  - Split tsconfigs: backend (`commonjs`) excludes `web/`; `web/tsconfig.json` (JSX,
    `moduleResolution: bundler`); `tsconfig.node.json` for `vite.config.ts`.
  - Same-origin via dev proxy + prod static serving → **no CORS**.
- **Consequences:** One `npm i` / `npm run start` for reviewers. TS upgrade is mandatory
  for modern Vite/React types.
- **Alternatives considered:** Separate `web/package.json` (cleaner dep separation, two
  installs — rejected for reviewer simplicity).

---

## DL-008 — "DRY" intent: reusable, but not speculative

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User (clarified)
- **Context:** The directive "avoid DRY … always create shared components" was ambiguous.
- **Decision:** Build presentational pieces as shared/reusable components, but **do not
  abstract prematurely** — extract a shared abstraction when a real second use appears,
  not speculatively. This reconciles "avoid over-engineering" with "always create shared
  components."
- **Consequences:** Shared component library grows from real usage; we avoid the wrong
  abstraction.

---

## DL-009 — Results grid: Click UI Table + server-side row cap; defer virtualization

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** Engineering
- **Context:** Result sets can be large; a naive table can hang the UI.
- **Decision:** Render results with the **Click UI Table** (DL-001) and **cap rows
  server-side** (default 1000, `truncated` flag + UI notice). Defer dedicated
  virtualization (`react-window` / `@tanstack/react-table`) until needed.
- **Consequences:** Simple, cohesive UI now; clear extension point if large-result UX
  becomes a requirement (would be a new decision).

---

## DL-010 — State in React Context/Providers, split by update frequency + memoization

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User (driving principles) + Engineering
- **Context:** User mandated Context/providers for state and memoization to prevent
  re-renders. A single context updated on every keystroke would re-render the whole tree.
- **Decision:**
  - `EditorProvider` owns the high-frequency editor document + plugin registry.
  - Query execution/results are **server state** owned by TanStack Query (DL-020), not a Context
    store; only editor/UI state lives in providers here.
  - Memoize context values with `useMemo`, stabilize callbacks with `useCallback`, wrap
    presentational components in `React.memo`. Split read/write contexts if profiling
    shows churn.
  - **State is split into one small provider per concern** (DL-019, which superseded the
    DL-012 selector approach) — each read with a plain `useContext` wrapper.
- **Consequences:** Typing in the editor does not re-render the results grid, and vice
  versa.

---

## DL-011 — The six evaluation criteria are the primary design drivers

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** The work will be judged primarily on: (1) code organization & overall
  architecture, (2) readability & maintainability, (3) component design & state-management
  approach, (4) handling of async flows / loading states / errors, (5) basic UX &
  usability, (6) thoughtfulness in trade-offs and decisions. These must be **rock-solid**.
- **Decision:** Treat the six criteria as the acceptance bar for every layer and PR. The
  Implementation Plan carries an explicit **"Evaluation criteria — how this design satisfies
  each"** table mapping each criterion to concrete mechanisms, and reviews check against it.
- **Consequences:**
  - Architecture (1) and component/state design (3) → enforced by the four-layer split,
    pure memoized components, Context-by-frequency, and the plugin registry (DL-005, DL-010).
  - Async/loading/errors (4) → TanStack Query `useMutation` (idle/pending/success/error) +
    `AbortSignal` + per-statement error reporting (DL-004/DL-020).
  - Readability/maintainability (2) and trade-offs (6) → small single-purpose modules plus
    this decision log and the buy-vs-build spike as durable rationale.
  - UX (5) → CodeMirror affordances, run + cancel, timing/row counts, truncation notice.
- **Alternatives considered:** Optimize for feature count / pixel-perfect styling — rejected;
  the brief explicitly prioritizes clarity, structure, and reasoning over polish.

---

## DL-012 — Read state via the selector pattern (subscribe to minimal slices)

> ⚠️ **Superseded by DL-019 (2026-06-20).** We dropped the custom selector store in favor of
> plain split React Context + `useState` (barebones). Retained below for history.

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Superseded by DL-019
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Even with contexts split by update frequency (DL-010), a component that calls
  `useContext` re-renders whenever **any** field of that context value changes — not just the
  slice it reads. To minimize re-renders and make each component's data dependencies explicit,
  state access should be **selector-based**: a component reads only the parts of state needed
  to support its action/render.
- **Decision:** Expose each state domain through a provider-held store and consume it via
  **selector hooks** — e.g. `useQuerySelector(s => s.status)`, `useEditorSelector(s => s.doc)`.
  A component re-renders **only when its selected slice changes** (equality-checked).
  - Subscription primitive: **React 18 `useSyncExternalStore`** (zero-dependency, canonical),
    with the store **created in and provided by the Context provider** — this honors DL-010
    ("state lives in providers") while enabling true selective subscription.
  - Selectors return the **smallest necessary data**. Default equality is `Object.is`; an
    optional custom comparator is supported for selectors that return objects/arrays.
  - **Actions** (`run`, `cancel`, `dispatch`, plugin registration) are read from a separate
    **stable handle**, so reading an action never triggers a re-render.
- **Consequences:**
  - Minimal-subscription re-renders; selectors are pure, unit-testable functions.
  - A component's coupling to state is explicit and narrow (supports SRP/DIP).
  - Slightly more plumbing than raw `useContext`; kept lean to avoid over-engineering.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Raw `useContext` — re-renders on any context change (rejected: violates the directive).
  - `use-context-selector` library — pure-context selector API; viable **buy** alternative if
    we prefer less hand-written store code (noted, not chosen by default).
  - Full store lib (Zustand/Redux) — built-in selectors but heavier and runs against the
    "use React Context/providers" directive (DL-010); rejected.

---

## DL-013 — Lightweight persistence: SQLite via `better-sqlite3`, behind repositories

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User (engine choice) + Engineering (design)
- **Context:** We need to persist user queries for re-use (named **saved queries**) and an
  automatic **run-history** log, server-side, using a lightweight DB.
- **Decision:** Use **`better-sqlite3`** (embedded single-file SQLite) accessed through
  **repository interfaces** (`historyRepository`, `savedQueryRepository`) so the engine is
  swappable and unit-testable with an in-memory fake (DIP).
  - Two tables: `query_history` (auto-logged on every run, success or error) and
    `saved_query` (explicit, named, for re-use) — distinct lifecycles.
  - Endpoints: `POST /query` auto-records history; `GET/DELETE /api/history`;
    `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/queries`.
  - Frontend exposes both as **editor plugins** (DL-006); their data is fetched/cached via
    **TanStack Query** (`useQuery` + `invalidateQueries`), DL-020.
- **Consequences:** Real SQL, easy to inspect; native module (ships prebuilt binaries); the
  DB file is added to `.gitignore`. Repository abstraction enables fast in-memory tests (DL-015).
- **Alternatives considered:** `node:sqlite` (experimental, needs Node 22+; repo targets 20+);
  `lowdb` (JSON file, weaker as history grows); reuse ClickHouse (OLAP mismatch + couples app
  state to the query target). All rejected.

---

## DL-014 — Caching strategy: targeted, not general

> ⚠️ **Superseded by DL-020 (2026-06-20).** We adopted TanStack Query as the server-state layer.
> DL-014's *policy* still holds (run results never cached; schema cached; ClickHouse query cache is
> a server toggle) — but the *mechanism* (hand-rolled stores / no library) is replaced. Retained for history.

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Superseded by DL-020
- **Decided by:** Engineering (answering "do we need caching?")
- **Context:** Asked whether caching is needed/helpful.
- **Decision:** **No general-purpose / result cache.** Cache in exactly one place and reuse
  existing mechanisms elsewhere:
  - **Schema/autocomplete metadata — cache** client-side in a `SchemaProvider` (manual
    "refresh schema" + optional TTL); read often, changes rarely.
  - **Query results — never cached** (freshness/correctness). ClickHouse's own query cache is
    an optional server-side toggle, not an app concern.
  - **History & saved queries — in-memory provider store**, invalidated on mutation; SQLite
    reads are local/fast.
  - **Render caching** via `React.memo` + context-splitting (DL-010/DL-019); **asset caching** via
    Vite content-hashed bundles.
- **Consequences:** Avoids stale-data bugs and over-engineering; the one cache (schema) gives
  a real autocomplete UX/perf win.
- **Alternatives considered:** App-level/Redis result cache (rejected: staleness +
  over-engineering); React Query for server-state (heavier than needed for a single screen).

---

## DL-015 — Testing strategy: pragmatic unit tests of critical systems/services/paths

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** "It's imperative we unit test the most important systems, services, and user
  paths — but don't spend a ton of time."
- **Decision:** **Vitest** (shared FE/BE) + `@testing-library/react`/`user-event` +
  `supertest`. Cover only the highest-risk/most-valuable targets:
  - `sql/splitStatements` + `sql/classify` (riskiest logic; tested over the golden dataset +
    edge cases).
  - Repositories (in-memory SQLite CRUD).
  - `POST /query` route (single/multi/stop-on-error/history logging; ClickHouse client mocked).
  - The run `useMutation` hook (TanStack, wrapped in `QueryClientProvider`) + `AbortSignal` cancellation.
  - One critical UI path (type → Run → results; load golden example → Run).
- **Consequences:** Meaningful safety net without coverage-chasing. Out of scope: exhaustive
  snapshots, Click UI internals, ClickHouse itself.
- **Alternatives considered:** No tests (rejected: explicit requirement); full coverage
  (rejected: time-boxed).

---

## DL-016 — Golden dataset: one source for UI examples **and** tests

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Need a golden dataset of SQL queries to run against the editor, **ideally
  visible in the UI** to demo the editor live.
- **Decision:** A single curated array (`web/src/data/goldenQueries.ts`, importable by backend
  tests) is the **one source of truth**:
  - **In the UI** — an `examplesPlugin` renders them as a selectable "Examples" list (Click UI);
    pick one to load into the editor and Run.
  - **In tests** — the same array feeds the splitter/classifier and `/query` route fixtures (DL-015).
  - Coverage: simple `SELECT`, `system.tables` browse, a self-contained multi-statement script
    (`CREATE/INSERT/SELECT` on a `Memory` table), a deliberately invalid query (error path),
    and a couple of aggregations.
- **Consequences:** The demo data and the test corpus never drift apart.
- **Contract file (2026-06-20):** `web/src/data/goldenQueries.ts` is a **shared contract file**
  (like `web/src/api/types.ts`) — imported by both the FE Examples picker and the BE tests. It must
  be **committed atomically with any dependent change** (it was once left untracked while committed
  code on both tracks imported it, breaking fresh clones — FE/BE review BLOCKER-1). Edits should be
  sanity-checked on both sides.
- **Alternatives considered:** Separate seed file vs. test fixtures (rejected: duplication/drift).

---

## DL-017 — Click UI components first; build custom only when Click UI lacks it

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted (refines DL-001)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** With Click UI adopted (DL-001), we need a clear default to keep the UI cohesive
  and avoid reinventing primitives.
- **Decision:** **Always reach for an existing Click UI component first.** Only build a custom
  component when Click UI genuinely doesn't provide one — and when we do, wrap it so it matches
  the design system. The canonical exception is the **SQL editor** (Click UI has no editor →
  CodeMirror, DL-002).
- **Consequences:** Consistent, accessible UI with minimal bespoke code; custom components are
  rare and justified. Reviewers can trust the UI layer is mostly first-party.
- **Alternatives considered:** Build-first / mix freely (rejected: inconsistency, wasted effort).
- **Refinement (2026-06-20, from FE review):** For surfaces/layout use Click UI **`Panel`**
  (bordered surface), **`Container`** (flex / padding / gap / overflow), and **`Separator`**. Click UI
  **`Card*`** components are rigid tiles (title/icon/description/badge props, **no children slot**),
  so they are **not** used for the statement result cards — `Panel` is the correct surface. Remaining
  bespoke CSS is limited to the app-shell grid, the truncated-SQL line, and the table column-header
  (no Click UI primitive for those).

---

## DL-018 — Engineering principles enforced via a skill + `CLAUDE.md`

- **Date:** 2026-06-19
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Every agent working in this codebase must load these technical decisions and
  principles **before building**. Skills alone are model-invoked and not guaranteed to load.
- **Decision:** Capture the full engineering playbook in a project skill
  (`.claude/skills/sql-editor-engineering/SKILL.md`) and **guarantee surfacing** by referencing
  it from **`CLAUDE.md`** (auto-loaded into every session for every agent), which also carries a
  concise rules block and a "read the skill before building" directive.
  - Note: the **`claude/`** folder (plan, this log, spike) is human documentation; the
    **`.claude/skills/`** folder is the machine-loaded skill. They are kept consistent.
- **Consequences:** Strong practical guarantee without fragile hooks. The skill + `CLAUDE.md`
  must be updated whenever a new decision is logged here (this file remains the source of truth).
- **Alternatives considered:** Skill only (no load guarantee); add a SessionStart/PreToolUse
  hook (hardest guarantee, more moving parts — deferred, can add later).

---

## DL-019 — State via plain split React Context + `useState` (barebones)

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (**supersedes DL-012**)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Reviewing frontend Slice 1 surfaced that the custom `createStore` + `useStore`
  selector hook reimplements React's official `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` — ~70 lines of
  infra we'd own for a correctness-sensitive job. The user asked for the **absolute simplest,
  barebones** solution and questioned why a custom store exists at all.
- **Decision:** Drop the custom selector store **and** the selector pattern. Store state in
  **plain React Context + `useState`/`useReducer`**, with **one small provider per concern**
  (editor, query, history, saved, schema). **No custom store, no selector library, no dependency.**
  - **Re-render isolation comes from splitting contexts by concern (DL-010)**, not selectors —
    e.g. the editor document lives in its own `EditorContext`, so typing cannot re-render the
    results pane. That's the only re-render problem at this app's scale, and context-splitting
    already solves it.
  - Memoize each provider's context `value` with `useMemo`; keep presentational components
    `React.memo` (DL-005).
  - Add selectors / `useShallow` / a store library **only if** a specific context later shows
    *measured* re-render problems — never speculatively (DL-008).
- **Consequences:**
  - Deletes `web/src/state/createStore.ts`, `web/src/hooks/useStore.ts`,
    `web/src/hooks/useEditorSelector.ts` and their tests. `EditorProvider` becomes Context +
    `useState` (still trivially testable through its hook). The provider tree in `main.tsx` is
    unchanged in shape.
  - Coarser re-renders *within* a single context — negligible here, and aligned with the
    "avoid over-engineering" principle.
  - **Documented scale-up path** if we ever outgrow it: **Zustand** is the industry-standard
    lightweight selector store; Redux Toolkit for heavyweight needs.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Keep the custom store (rejected: reinvents an official utility; ~70 LOC + correctness burden).
  - Official `use-sync-external-store/with-selector` shim (rejected: still selector machinery we
    don't need yet).
  - **Zustand** via context / `use-context-selector` (rejected *for now*: a dependency, and more
    than "barebones" requires — kept as the documented scale-up path, not the default).

---

## DL-020 — TanStack Query as the server-state / data-fetching layer (supersedes DL-014)

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (**supersedes DL-014**; refines the data-fetch parts of DL-004/005/010/013/015)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Reviewing the *planned* custom `apiClient` + `useRunQuery` + hand-rolled
  history/saved/schema caches, the user asked why we'd build a custom data layer instead of using
  TanStack Query. The app has two kinds of server interaction: an imperative, **uncached** run-query
  POST, and **cacheable** GETs (history, saved queries, schema). (Nothing custom was built yet —
  `web/src/api/` had only `types.ts` — so this is a zero-refactor choice.)
- **Decision:** Adopt **`@tanstack/react-query`** as the entire **server-state** layer. Client/UI
  state stays plain Context + `useState` (DL-019) — orthogonal: *server* state vs *UI* state.
  - **Run query → `useMutation`.** Imperative, **never cached** (results must be fresh — preserves
    DL-014's policy); pass `AbortSignal` for cancellation. Replaces the planned custom `useRunQuery`
    state machine (`useMutation` already exposes idle/pending/success/error).
  - **History / saved queries / schema → `useQuery`** keyed per resource; **mutations call
    `invalidateQueries`** to refresh. Replaces the hand-rolled in-memory stores + manual
    invalidation (DL-013) and the manual schema cache (DL-014). Schema uses a long `staleTime` +
    manual refetch ("refresh schema").
  - Only custom data code is **thin typed fetch fns** under `api/` (returning the
    `web/src/api/types.ts` shapes); TanStack wraps them. `QueryClientProvider` joins the provider
    tree in `main.tsx`.
- **Consequences:**
  - Deletes the planned custom `apiClient` state plumbing + `useRunQuery`; adds
    `@tanstack/react-query` (~13 kB gz — marginal next to Click UI + CodeMirror).
  - Loading/error/abort, dedup, and cache-invalidation come from the industry-standard server-state
    lib, shrinking custom surface and bug risk.
  - **Eval criterion #4 (async/loading/errors)** is demonstrated via correct TanStack usage
    (mutation states, `AbortSignal`, query invalidation) rather than a hand-rolled machine.
  - Tests wrap hooks in a `QueryClientProvider`; the run path is a `useMutation` test (DL-015).
- **Alternatives considered:** Hybrid (TanStack for GETs, custom `useRunQuery` for run, to showcase
  async handling directly) — viable, **rejected by the user** in favor of one consistent data layer;
  keep-custom / no dependency (rejected: reinvents fetch + cache + invalidate).

## DL-021 — Theming: dark/light switcher + Click UI design tokens

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (resolves the hardcoded-hex NOTE from R1/R2)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** The app shell used hardcoded hex colors and there was no theme toggle; the user
  wanted dark/light support and styling consistent with the Click UI design system.
- **Decision:** A `ThemeProvider` owns `light|dark` (reducer + own `localStorage`) and feeds
  `ClickUIProvider`'s `theme` prop with **`persistTheme={false}`** (we own persistence). A
  `ThemeSwitcher` (Click UI `Button`) in the toolbar toggles it. Shell CSS uses **Click UI design
  tokens** (`var(--click-global-color-*)`) instead of hex, so the custom shell re-themes
  automatically via the root `data-cui-theme` attribute set by `ClickUIProvider`. `ThemeProvider`
  is outermost in the provider tree.
- **Consequences:** One switch re-themes both Click UI components and the custom shell; no hardcoded
  colors remain (only layout). **Confirmed in-browser by the product owner (2026-06-20).**
- **Alternatives considered:** Click UI's built-in theme persistence (rejected: we persist to our
  own key); CSS-only media-query dark mode (rejected: no user control, wouldn't drive Click UI).

## DL-022 — Provider state uses `useReducer` + action creators (refines DL-019)

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (refines DL-019)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** DL-019 allows plain `useState`/`useReducer`. The user prefers reducers + semantic
  action creators over ad-hoc `useState` setters, for explicit and testable transitions.
- **Decision:** UI-state Context providers model state with **`useReducer`** + an action union +
  semantic action creators (`setDoc`, `toggleTheme`). Reducers stay **pure**; side effects (e.g.
  `localStorage` persistence) live in `useEffect`. The context `value` is `useMemo`'d.
  (Run-query state remains a TanStack `useMutation` — DL-020; this applies to UI-state providers.)
- **Consequences:** Explicit, unit-testable transitions and a consistent provider shape. Still no
  custom store / selector library (DL-019).

---

## DL-023 — Container / presentational split via a `containers/` layer (refines DL-005)

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (refines DL-005)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** `App.tsx` had accumulated connected-wrapper logic; the user asked to split it.
- **Decision:** Three UI tiers:
  - **`components/`** — pure, `React.memo`, props-only, Click UI-based. No hooks/state.
  - **`containers/`** — connected wrappers that consume hooks/providers and pass plain props down
    (`EditorPane`, `RunControls`, `ResultsRegion`, `ThemeSwitcher`).
  - **`App.tsx`** — composition root; reads **no** state, so it never re-renders.
  Each container subscribes to **only its** provider, so re-renders stay isolated (DL-010) — e.g.
  `ResultsRegion` reads only the query provider, so typing never re-renders results.
- **Consequences:** Presentation stays logic-free/testable; subscription boundaries are explicit;
  `App` never re-renders. Clear home for the future plugin-contributed wrappers.

## DL-024 — Feature scope vs. ClickHouse SQL Console (gap analysis)

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Benchmarked against ClickHouse Cloud's SQL Console
  ([docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/sql-clients/sql-console)) to find gaps. That's a
  mature product; most of its surface is out of scope for this exercise, but a few gaps are cheap
  and high-value.
- **Decision:** Adopt a prioritized subset as scoped follow-ups — each an **editor plugin /
  toolbar action** (DL-006) where it fits — and explicitly defer the rest:
  - **Will add (high-value, low-cost):** export results as **CSV**; **schema browser sidebar**
    (databases → tables → columns over `system.tables`/`system.columns`, feeding autocomplete);
    **result-set search**; **client-side column sort**; saved-query polish (Cmd/Ctrl+S + inline
    rename) alongside the Slice-3 saved-queries UI.
  - **Already on the roadmap (Slice 3):** history UI, saved-queries UI, examples (golden dataset),
    schema autocomplete, file-import plugin.
  - **Deliberately deferred / out of scope (trade-off, not omission):** charts/visualizations;
    GenAI NL→SQL & "Fix Query" (separate AI integration); multiple query tabs (structural, low
    marginal value here); sharing/collaboration (needs auth/multi-user); server-side pagination
    (we cap results at 1000 instead — DL-009); filter→SQL builder.
- **Consequences:** Closes the most visible UX gaps cheaply while keeping scope honest; the
  deferred list makes the trade-offs explicit for reviewers (eval criterion #6).

---

## DL-025 — Schema explorer + autocomplete: one slice, shared data, plugin panel

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** The ClickHouse SQL Console has a table/schema explorer (databases → tables → columns)
  plus schema-aware autocomplete. DL-024 listed the explorer as a "will add." Both need the same
  `system.tables` / `system.columns` data, and neither is scheduled yet.
- **Decision:** Build them as **one slice, scheduled right after Saved queries (3c)**. A single
  **`useSchema`** (TanStack `useQuery`, cached — DL-020) feeds both:
  - a **`schemaPlugin`** panel — databases → tables → expandable columns; clicking inserts a table
    name via `ctx.setDoc`. Same `renderPanel` shape as History/Examples, so it drops into the plugin
    architecture with no editor-core changes (DL-006).
  - **CodeMirror autocomplete** via `sql({ schema })` from the same cached schema.
  - **Data source:** reuse the existing **`POST /query`** (run `SELECT … FROM system.columns` /
    `SHOW TABLES`) — **no new backend endpoint**. Revisit a dedicated `/api/schema` only if needed.
  - **Placement:** a **toggled plugin panel** (consistent with the History/Examples rail), **not** a
    permanent left sidebar.
- **Consequences:** Schema is fetched/cached **once** and shared by the panel + autocomplete; zero
  backend work; no core changes. Trade-off: a toggled panel is less prominent than the console's
  always-on sidebar.
- **Alternatives considered:** separate explorer/autocomplete fetches (rejected: double-fetch);
  dedicated `/api/schema` endpoint (deferred: `/query` suffices); permanent left sidebar (deferred:
  structural layout change — a future upsell).

## DL-026 — Plugin toolbar: icon activity-rail + one left panel with a placement seam

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** As plugins grow (Examples, History, Saved, Schema, …) the text-button toolbar
  clutters and reads unlike a SQL IDE. The user also weighed a left **and** right panel split. But
  every current plugin is a "browse → load SQL into the editor" **source**; there's no
  inspection/detail plugin yet.
- **Decision:**
  - **Icon activity-rail** for plugin toggles. Each plugin gets an **`icon`** (Click UI icon); the
    toggle is an icon button with a **tooltip + `aria-label` (= `toolbarLabel`) +
    `aria-pressed`/`aria-expanded`** (resolves the R4/R7 a11y note). Matches the ClickHouse console
    and scales.
  - **One panel now + a `placement?: 'left' | 'right'` seam** on `EditorPlugin` (default `'left'`).
    All current plugins are **left** ("sources": Examples, History, Saved, Schema). A **right** panel
    is reserved for **inspection/detail** plugins (cell inspector, query stats/plan, column details —
    DL-024 deferred) and only materializes once one exists — **don't build the right panel now**
    (nothing distinct for it → over-engineering).
  - The rail groups toggles by placement (left-edge for left plugins; a right-edge group appears only
    when a right plugin exists). Each side toggles its own panel, so a left source + a right detail
    can show **simultaneously** once a right plugin lands.
- **Consequences:** cleaner, IDE-like, scalable toolbar; the left/right capability is future-proofed
  for ~one interface field; no right-panel code until justified. `EditorPlugin` gains `icon` +
  `placement?`. Directive for the FE (plugin slices 3c+).
- **Alternatives considered:** text buttons (clutter as plugins grow); icon+label (widest); build
  both panels now (empty right → over-engineering); no placement field (a later right panel would
  mean reworking the plugin interface + layout).

## DL-027 — Toast notifications for user-action confirmations

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** Discrete user actions (save query, copy to clipboard, clear editor, file import) need
  lightweight, transient confirmation feedback.
- **Decision:** Use **Click UI's toast system** (provided by the root `ClickUIProvider` — already in
  the tree; design-system-first, DL-017). Expose it via a thin **`useToast()`** hook so business-logic
  hooks / containers / plugins fire toasts (`toast.success('Query saved')`, etc.) **without
  presentational components importing Click UI toast internals** (components stay pure — DL-005/DL-023).
  - Fire toasts from the **action layer** (containers / plugins / mutation `onSuccess`|`onError`), not
    from pure components.
  - **Scope:** transient confirmations of discrete actions — query saved/updated/deleted, copied to
    clipboard, editor cleared, import succeeded/failed.
  - **Do NOT toast outcomes already surfaced inline** (per-statement query results/errors) — toasts
    are for *actions*, not query results; avoid double-surfacing.
  - **Verify the exact Click UI v0.6.1 toast API** (hook/props) against its storybook before use —
    don't assume the signature (cf. the `cui.css` mistake, DL-001).
- **Consequences:** consistent, on-brand transient feedback; presentational components stay pure; one
  wrapper to swap if the toast mechanism ever changes.
- **Alternatives considered:** a custom toast component (rejected — Click UI ships one, DL-017);
  inline status text only (rejected — less discoverable for transient confirmations); toasting query
  errors too (rejected — already shown inline; would double-surface).

## DL-028 — Build the right panel; Schema explorer is right-placed

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (activates the DL-026 `placement` seam; **supersedes DL-026's "defer the right
  panel until a right plugin exists"**)
- **Decided by:** User
- **Context:** DL-026 added the `placement` seam but deferred *building* the right rail/panel until a
  right-placement plugin existed (to avoid over-engineering). The user directed that the **Schema
  explorer (DL-025) be a right-docked panel** and that the right rail/panel be built now.
- **Decision:** Build the **right rail + right panel**. `schemaPlugin` is `placement: 'right'`. `App`
  holds **independent left/right open-state**, so a left "source" panel (Examples/History/Saved) and
  the right Schema panel can be open **simultaneously** (the payoff DL-026 anticipated). `PluginPanel`
  is side-aware (border side); a second `PluginRail` renders on the right edge.
- **Consequences:** the right panel exists now. This **refines DL-026's taxonomy** — Schema is a
  "source" (browse → load) yet docked on the right by product choice (IDE-like layout: editor centre,
  schema right), rather than on the left with the other sources. Future inspection plugins can also
  use the right side.
- **Alternatives considered:** Schema on the left with the other sources (the DL-026 default) —
  rejected by the product owner in favour of a right-docked explorer layout.

---

## DL-029 — `/query` `recordHistory` opt-out for internal reads

- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Status:** Accepted (implements the DL-025 fallback; resolves FE review R10 HIGH-1)
- **Decided by:** Engineering (reviewer fix, per product-owner "fix HIGH-1")
- **Context:** The schema explorer reuses `POST /query` (DL-025), but the backend auto-logs **every**
  `/query` run to history (DL-013) — so schema reads on app load polluted the user's History panel
  (R10 HIGH-1).
- **Decision:** `POST /query` accepts an optional **`recordHistory: boolean`** in the body
  (default `true`). When `false`, the route skips history logging (passes `undefined` to the history
  repository). The schema fetch (`fetchSchema`) sets `recordHistory: false`; the run-query mutation
  keeps the default (logs). `apiClient.runQuery` gains an `{ recordHistory }` option; `RunRequest`
  documents the field.
- **Consequences:** internal reads no longer pollute the run history. Covered by a backend test
  (`recordHistory:false` → no history row).
- **Alternatives considered:** a dedicated `GET /api/schema` (DL-025's other fallback — cleaner
  separation, but more code and moves the transform server-side) — deferred; a request header instead
  of a body field (equivalent; body chosen for simplicity).

---

## DL-030 — File import plugin UX: schema-backed table picker, derived format, lifecycle-correct upload

- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decided by:** Engineering (product-owner feedback during the import slice)
- **Context:** First hands-on use of the `fileImportPlugin` surfaced several UX/behaviour gaps:
  the target **table** was a free-text field (the user had no way to know which tables exist);
  the **format** was a manual dropdown the user expected to be inferred; the panel **close**
  control was a text "Close" button; and on a *successful* import the Click UI `FileUpload`
  flipped to a red error state with a dead Retry button.
- **Decision:**
  - **Table = dropdown from the schema** (`useSchema`, DL-025), values **database-qualified**
    (`db.table`) via `qualifiedTableNames` — import only ever targets an existing table, so the
    cached schema is the right source, not free text or the filename. The dropdown mirrors the
    schema query's loading/empty/error states (DL-020).
  - **Format = derived default, still editable** (`formatForFileName`): the file extension
    pre-selects the format (`.csv`→`CSVWithNames`, `.tsv`/`.tab`→`TabSeparatedWithNames`,
    `.json`/`.ndjson`→`JSONEachRow`). It can only be a *default* — the extension can't reveal
    whether a CSV/TSV has a header (`CSV` vs `CSVWithNames`) — so the dropdown stays for override.
  - **Panel collapse control** is a directional chevron in `PluginPanel` (left panel →
    `chevron-left`, right panel → `chevron-right`), replacing the text button (DL-026 placement).
  - **Upload lifecycle:** `FileUpload` is uncontrolled (owns its selected-file state) and renders
    red whenever it is neither in a success nor progress state. So `showSuccess` is mapped to the
    mutation state (`file && !isError`), `onRetry`/`failureMessage` are wired so a *real* failure
    has a working retry, the mutation is `reset()` on new-file-select/close, and the component is
    **remounted (key bump)** on success to truly clear it instead of falling into the error state.
  - **`/import` added to the Vite dev proxy** (it 404'd in dev — only `/query` and `/api` were
    proxied to Express).
- **Consequences:** import targets are unambiguous and discoverable; the common case needs no
  manual format pick; success leaves the panel clean and failures are recoverable in place. Pure
  helpers (`qualifiedTableNames`, `formatForFileName`) are unit-tested; the plugin integration test
  drives the schema-backed dropdown and asserts the post-success reset.
- **Alternatives considered:** deriving the table from the filename (rejected — yields only a name
  with no existence guarantee, and the backend does no table creation/inference); full header
  sniffing to remove the format control (rejected — heuristic, silently corrupts data when wrong);
  an editable combobox allowing off-schema table names (deferred — not needed yet, DL-008).

## DL-031 — AI assistant: NL→SQL via a server-side Claude proxy, surfaced as an editor plugin

- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Status:** Accepted — **provider/model/SDK/env superseded by DL-032** (free-tier provider). The
  architecture below (plugin, server-side proxy, never-auto-run, structured output, mockable port,
  schema-aware, graceful 503) still stands; only the LLM behind the port changed.
- **Decided by:** User (high-priority feature) + Engineering (architecture)
- **Context:** Add an AI assistant: a chat panel where the user asks in plain language and Claude
  generates a SQL query. The app has no LLM integration yet (greenfield). Per the `claude-api` skill
  this is a Claude/Anthropic build; the authoritative API reference was consulted before fixing any
  model/SDK specifics.
- **Decision:**
  - **Plugin, not core (DL-006).** An `aiAssistantPlugin` (`placement: 'left'`, source-style) opens a
    chat panel; same `renderPanel`/hook-safety shape as History/Saved/Schema/Examples. No editor-core
    changes.
  - **Server-side Claude proxy — key never touches the browser.** A new backend route
    `POST /api/ai/sql` accepts `{ prompt, schema? }` and calls Claude with `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
    (`client.messages.create`). The API key is read from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (server env) only.
  - **Model `claude-opus-4-8`** (user choice — most accurate NL→SQL); adaptive thinking on,
    `output_config.effort: "low"` (SQL-gen is short). Behind an injectable port so the model/provider
    is swappable and **mockable in tests** (mirrors the `ClickHouseExecutor` DIP pattern, DL-005).
  - **Structured output, not raw text.** Use `output_config.format` (JSON schema) /
    `messages.parse` → `{ sql: string, explanation?: string }`, so the response is reliably just the
    SQL (no prose-stripping). Backend returns `{ sql, explanation? }`; transport errors → `{ error }`.
  - **Schema-aware.** The plugin passes the cached `useSchema` tree (DL-025) so generated SQL
    references real tables/columns; the route embeds it in the system prompt.
  - **Never auto-run (user choice).** Generated SQL is **loaded into the editor** via `ctx.setDoc`;
    the user always reviews and clicks Run. No auto-execute, no write/DDL gating needed.
  - **No key → graceful 503.** When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset the route returns
    503 `{ error: 'AI assistant not configured' }`; the plugin shows a friendly "set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    message. The app runs fully without a key.
  - **TanStack `useMutation`** drives the request (idle/pending/error), like the run mutation (DL-020);
    not cached.
- **Consequences:** new dep `@anthropic-ai/sdk`; new `src/server/ai/` (client port + factory) and
  `routes/ai.ts`; FE `api/ai.ts` + `useGenerateSql` + `aiAssistantPlugin`. Built/tested/merged with a
  **mocked** client (no key required); live use needs a Console API key (separate from Claude Pro).
  Key is gitignored (`.env`) and server-only — never in the bundle or logs.
- **Alternatives considered:** call Claude directly from the browser (rejected — exposes the key);
  return raw text and parse the SQL out (rejected — structured output is reliable); auto-run generated
  SQL (rejected by the user — load into editor for review); Haiku/Sonnet (offered; user chose Opus 4.8
  for accuracy); tool-use/agentic loop (deferred — single structured generation suffices, DL-008).

## DL-032 — AI assistant LLM: Google Gemini (free tier), not Anthropic (supersedes DL-031's provider)

- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Status:** Accepted (supersedes the provider/model/SDK/env-var parts of DL-031)
- **Decided by:** User (wants a $0 key) + Engineering (provider pick)
- **Context:** A Claude Pro subscription grants no API access, and Anthropic has no permanent free
  tier. The user chose a **free-tier provider** over keeping Claude. The `claude-api` skill produces
  Anthropic code, so it does **not** apply to this feature — we use the chosen provider's own SDK.
- **Decision:** Use **Google Gemini (AI Studio free tier)** as the NL→SQL LLM, behind the same
  `SqlGenerator` port from DL-031 (so the rest of DL-031 is unchanged):
  - **Provider/SDK:** official Google GenAI Node SDK (`@google/genai`), `generateContent` with a JSON
    **`responseSchema`** (Gemini native structured output) → `{ sql, explanation? }`. **Verify the
    exact SDK surface + current free-tier model ID against official Google AI docs at implementation
    time — do not guess** (cf. the `cui.css` lesson, DL-001).
  - **Model:** a current fast Gemini model on the free tier (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash` / `gemini-2.0-flash`
    — confirm the exact ID and free-tier eligibility before wiring).
  - **Env var:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-only, gitignored `.env`). Unset → the route's graceful
    503 from DL-031 still applies (message generalized to "AI assistant not configured").
  - **Unchanged from DL-031:** `aiAssistantPlugin` (left, never-auto-run → `ctx.setDoc`), server proxy
    `POST /api/ai/sql`, schema-aware prompt (DL-025), injectable/**mockable** port (built+tested with a
    fake; no key needed), `useGenerateSql` TanStack mutation. Free tier has rate limits — surface 429s
    as a friendly "try again in a moment" in the plugin.
- **Consequences:** dep is `@google/genai` (not `@anthropic-ai/sdk`); the model behind the port is the
  only real change. $0 key from AI Studio; off the Claude path for this one feature (the rest of the
  app is unaffected). Provider stays swappable behind `SqlGenerator` (Groq/OpenRouter are alternatives).
- **Alternatives considered:** **Groq** free tier (OpenAI-compatible, very fast open models —
  viable drop-in behind the same port; not chosen because Gemini's native `responseSchema` maps more
  cleanly to our structured contract and its free tier is generous); **OpenRouter** free models
  (more variable availability); keeping Anthropic with a small prepay (rejected by the user — wanted free).

## DL-033 — Import can create the target table (Nullable(String) from the header)

- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Status:** Accepted (extends DL-006/DL-030; revisits the "table must already exist" limit)
- **Decided by:** User (product owner) — "stick with [data import], but allow the user to create a new table."
- **Context:** Import (DL-030) only targeted *existing* tables, so importing into a fresh table meant
  hand-writing DDL first. The product owner asked to create the table inline as part of the import.
- **Decision:** `POST /import` accepts an optional `createTable` flag. When set, the backend infers
  **column names** from the file's first line (header for `…WithNames`/`JSONEachRow`; positional
  `c1..cN` for the headerless formats) and runs
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <table> (<col> Nullable(String), …) ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY tuple()`
  via `executor.command` **before** the insert. Types are intentionally all `Nullable(String)` — a
  deterministic, dependency-free choice that accepts any value the file holds (no fragile type
  inference); the user can re-type columns later. The frontend table picker became a searchable,
  **creatable** Click UI `Select` (`allowCreateOption`): pick an existing table or type a new name.
  A typed name not in the schema is treated as new (`createTable: true`). `useImportFile` now
  invalidates the schema query on success so a created table appears in the explorer/picker.
- **Consequences:** import no longer requires pre-creating a table; new tables show up immediately.
  All-String columns are a deliberate MVP trade-off (over-engineering avoidance) — typed inference
  is a possible follow-up. Verified end-to-end against the ClickHouse container (create → insert →
  count). Covered by `inferColumnNames` unit tests + a route test (CREATE then insert).
- **Alternatives considered:** client- or server-side **type sniffing** (rejected for now — fiddly,
  error-prone, against the "avoid over-engineering" rule); a per-column **type editor** in the panel
  (heavier UI; deferred); ClickHouse server-side schema inference (needs the data on the CH server /
  a table function — not available for a buffered HTTP upload).

---

## DL-034 — Readable errors: clean ClickHouse messages + colour-coded toasts

- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Status:** Accepted (refines DL-027 toasts + DL-004 error surfaces)
- **Decided by:** Engineering (product-owner feedback: errors are unreadable, toasts aren't coloured)
- **Context:** ClickHouse echoes the failing SQL (and a build tag) in its error messages, so a query
  with a long IN-list / a rejected import produced multi-KB errors that blew out the results panel
  and the toasts. Separately, Click UI toasts only tint the *icon* by type — the surface stayed
  neutral, so success/error weren't distinguishable at a glance.
- **Decision:**
  - **`formatClickHouseError` (`web/src/api/formatError.ts`)** — a pure helper that normalises
    whitespace, strips the trailing `(version …)` tag, and cuts the echoed query / "Expected one of"
    token dump at known markers. Applied where errors are shown: the per-statement card and the
    transport-error banner (`StatementResultCard`/`ResultsPanel`), and the import error toast. The
    failing SQL is already shown on the card, so dropping the echo loses nothing.
  - **Scroll cap** — `.statement-card__error { max-height: 200px; overflow-y: auto }` so an unusually
    long (even post-clean) message scrolls within the card instead of pushing results down.
  - **Coloured toasts** — `useToast` attaches a per-type class (`cui-toast cui-toast--{success|
    danger|warning|info}`); `styles.css` tints the surface with `--click-alert-color-background-*`
    tokens (DL-021). The doubled class out-specifies the styled-component's background without
    `!important`. Error toast text is truncated (`truncateForToast`) so a toast can't cover the screen.
- **Consequences:** errors read cleanly in both surfaces; toast type is obvious by colour. Covered by
  `formatError` unit tests; toast coloring verified structurally (Click UI forwards `className` to the
  toast root; the alert background tokens exist in the built theme).
- **Alternatives considered:** a fully neutral "show the raw error, just scrollable" (rejected — the
  echoed SQL is pure noise next to the card's SQL); patching Click UI's Toast directly (rejected —
  styling via tokens + class is non-invasive and upgrade-safe).

## DL-035 — Refresh the cached schema after schema-changing DDL runs

- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Status:** Accepted (extends DL-020 caching + DL-025 schema; complements DL-033's import invalidation)
- **Decided by:** User (product owner) — "the schema panel needs to refresh when a table is dropped
  or created, or a column is edited."
- **Context:** The schema (`useSchema`) is cached with a long `staleTime` and feeds both the explorer
  panel and CodeMirror autocomplete. Running DDL in the editor (`CREATE`/`DROP`/`ALTER` …) changed
  the database but left the cached tree stale until the TTL elapsed. Import already invalidated the
  schema on success (DL-033); editor runs did not.
- **Decision:** `useRunQuery` invalidates `SCHEMA_QUERY_KEY` in `onSuccess` when the run included a
  schema-changing statement, detected by a small pure helper `affectsSchema(statements)` in
  `api/schema.ts` (leading keyword in `{CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, ATTACH, DETACH, EXCHANGE}`;
  `TRUNCATE`/`INSERT`/`SET` excluded — they don't alter the tree). The keyword scan mirrors the
  backend `classify.leadingKeyword` (skips whitespace/comments) but lives on the frontend because the
  backend module isn't importable across the build boundary and this is a cache-invalidation concern,
  not execution. Autocomplete keeps `useSchema` observed, so the invalidation refetches immediately.
- **Consequences:** the explorer + autocomplete reflect DDL right after a run. A failed DDL still
  triggers a (harmless) refetch; non-DDL runs don't refetch the schema. Covered by `affectsSchema`
  unit tests + a `useRunQuery` test (DDL invalidates, SELECT doesn't).
- **Alternatives considered:** invalidate on any `command`-kind statement (rejected — `INSERT`/`SET`
  are commands too, so every data run would refetch the schema); a finer backend classification +
  contract flag (more plumbing for no extra correctness); a manual "refresh" button (doesn't satisfy
  "it should just refresh").
